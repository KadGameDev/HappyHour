> We’re looking for speakers to talk about game development, could we contact you to come to our event / group / organisation?

Yes, you may! Simply contact us at info@gamedevhappyhour.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.


> I’m looking for a job / internship in the game development industry, can you help?

Sorry, but can not officialy endorse recruiters. However, we actively host free to attend events with topics on career growth and encourage our members to network between themselves.


> Hello! I’m with a media outlet and would like to speak with you about the community / industry / anything game development related?

Hello media outlet person! You can contact us at info@gamedevhappyhour.com


> Can I attend these events if I’m not a game developer?

Yes, you’re welcome to attend, though we encourage people with an active interest or involvement in the industry! Do keep in mind though that we are a community of game developers, so conversations and presentations will be skewed as such.
